# Hi! 
I'm Arturo Amaya*. I'm 21. I'm a Computer Engineering major here at UCSD. 
This is a picture of my cat:

Here's another picture of my cat:

His name is Mapalé.

I've lived in Virginia, Mexico and Colombia, so the answer to the question "Where are you from?" is a long one. However, the answer to the question "what do you want to do once you graduate?" is a short one - I have no idea.

Over the past year I haven't really coded all that much aside from a set of PHP database programs. I didn't like sitting down for several hours to write code when I was already inside all day trying to not contract COVID. That's partly why I've waited so long to take this class.

Actually, I kind of lost interest in a lot of things while at home. It's really nice to be near campus meeting new people and all that. :)

Some (but not all) of the things I still enjoy are:
watching football (the not-American kind)*.
watching football analysis videos from Tifo Football
swimming
craft beers - specifically super bitter IPAs*
really dumb jokes and standup comedy
playing smash
bad movies*
sitcoms, for some reason

Speaking of, my 5 favorite sitcoms are:
Futurama
Friends
Ted Lasso
Seinfeld
Brooklyn Nine-Nine

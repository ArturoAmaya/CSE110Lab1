I completed everything using the windows fullscreensnip 
tool but when I went to put all the screenshots together they were gone.
I just redid everything to get new screenshots, but certain commands had to be different.
There already was a add-read-me branch so instead of making it for step 2 I just checked that it existed.
I edited my page's README.md to include a similar note for step 3.
The rest should all be the same.
